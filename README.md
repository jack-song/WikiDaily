Small test harness for code that is now Amazon-hosted. What a world we live in. I saw that this skill I first launched years ago for a bit of fun was broken. Trying to fix it, I've learned that:

1. YQL is dead.
2. Amazon has a prepackaged, self hosted web IDE suite for Alexa skills.
3. The `request` node package is defunct.

## Notes

Setup:

- npm install got cheerio

Test:

- npx ./test.js
